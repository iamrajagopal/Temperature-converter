# Temperature-converter

The Temperature Converter is a web application that enables users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin units. This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly and interactive temperature conversion tool.

## Features

2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Using a Web Browser

1. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
2. Enter a temperature value in any of the input fields (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
